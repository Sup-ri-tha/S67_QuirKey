Project Title:
"QuirKey : Weirdest Keychain Collections"

Project Overview:
The project is a web application where users can create, view, and manage lists of the weirdest, funniest, or most unique keychains they own or have encountered. The purpose is to explore the diverse and quirky world of keychains, allowing users to upload pictures, write short descriptions, and even "trade" keychains virtually with others. Each user’s list will be unique to their account.

Key Features:

User Accounts: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their keychain lists.
Unique Lists: Each user gets a personalized list of keychains, with options to add, edit, and delete entries.
Image Uploads: Users can upload pictures of keychains to showcase their collections.
Social Sharing: Users can “like” or comment on keychains in other users' lists.
Keychain Trading: A virtual trading feature where users can exchange keychains.
Quirk Meter: A fun, interactive “quirkiness” score based on user interactions.
Tech Stack:

Frontend: React with Vite for a fast and efficient user interface.
Backend: Node.js and Express.js for server-side functionality.
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage and schema management.
Authentication: Firebase Auth or session storage for secure user login.
Deployment: GitHub, Vercel (frontend), and Render (backend).
Extras: Cloudinary for image hosting and API testing via Postman/Bruno.
Why This Project:
This project is both unique and entertaining, satisfying the requirement to be “silly” while giving you practical experience with essential full-stack development concepts. Managing user accounts, creating APIs, and deploying a working application will help you master skills like database schema creation, frontend-backend integration, authentication, and optional advanced topics like caching or Docker. The idea is lighthearted but demonstrates serious technical capabilities.
